       "\"The London Marathon, one of the six World Marathon Majors, has been contested by men and women annually since 29 March 1981. Set over a largely flat course around the River Thames, the marathon is 26.2 miles (42.2 km) in length and generally regarded as a competitive and unpredictable event, and conducive to fast times.The inaugural marathon had 7,741 entrants, 6,255 of whom completed the race. The first Men's Elite Race was tied between American Dick Beardsley and Norwegian Inge Simonsen, who crossed the finish line holding hands in 2 hours, 11 minutes, 48 seconds. The first Women's Elite Race was won by Briton Joyce Smith in 2:29:57. In 1983, the first wheelchair races took place. Organized by the British Sports Association for the Disabled (BASD), 19 people competed and 17 finished. Gordon Perry of the United Kingdom won the Men's Wheelchair Race, coming in at 3:20:07, and Denise Smith, also of the UK, won the Women's Wheelchair Race in 4:29:03.Twenty athletes representing the United Kingdom have won the London Marathon a total of forty times. The most recent win by a British athlete was in the 2012 London Marathon, by David Weir in the Men's Wheelchair Race. It was his sixth win in London. Kenya has the second largest number of winning athletes. Seven Kenyan men and seven Kenyan women have been victorious a total of eighteen times, all in the able-bodied category. Eleven men, including those from the wheelchair races, have won the marathon more than once, Weir's six wins being the record. Sixteen women have been winners more than once; Tanni Grey-Thompson won the women's wheelchair race six times between 1992 and 2002.\\nCourse records for the London Marathon have been set ten times in the men's race, seven times in the women's race, fifteen times in the men's wheelchair race, and thirteen times in the women's wheelchair race. World records for marathon running have been set six times considering marks for men and women in mixed sex and women-only races. Khalid Khannouchi, representing the United States, set the men's world record in 2:05:38 in 2002. The following year, British runner Paula Radcliffe set the women's world record in 2:15:25, which also stands as the current course record in the Women's Elite Race. In 2017 Kenyan Mary Keitany ran a women-only race world record of 2:17:01.  Eliud Kipchoge of Kenya set the course record at 2:03:05 in 2016 in the Men's Elite Race. Kurt Fearnley set the Men's Wheelchair Race course record at 1:28:57 in 2009. The course record for the Women's Wheelchair Race was set by Swiss athlete Manuela Schar in 2017, with 1:39:57.\""

       "\"The New York City Marathon is a 42,195-meter (26.2 mile) race through all five boroughs of New York City, and ranks as the largest marathon in the world, with a record 51,392 finishers (29,927 men/21,465 women) in 2016. Since its inaugural race in 1970, 34 men and 25 women have won the open division of the New York City Marathon, representing 22 different countries. From 1970 through 1975, the race was held entirely in Central Park. It has started in Staten Island and gone through New York City's other four boroughs since 1976. Grete Waitz of Norway has won the race more than any other athlete, having completed her 9th victory in 1988, setting three course records in the process. Current course records were set by Geoffrey Mutai of Kenya in 2011 in the men's division, and by Margaret Okayo of Kenya in 2003 in the women's division.\\nA wheelchair race has been held since 2000. Among the wheelchair racers, Edith Hunkeler of Switzerland and Tatyana McFadden of USA has the most victories, with five each (McFadden has four in a row). Tatyana McFadden also holds the women's course record with a time of 1:43:04 set in 2015, while Kurt Fearnley of Australia holds the men's record with 1:29:22 set in 2006.\""

       "\"The Berlin Marathon (branded BMW Berlin Marathon for sponsorship reasons) is a major running and sporting event held annually in Berlin, Germany. The official marathon distance of 42.195 kilometers (26 miles 385 yards) is set up as a citywide road race where professional athletes and amateur runners jointly participate. Initiated in 1974, the event traditionally takes place on the last weekend in September, with the exceptions of 2000, because of a conflict with the Olympic Marathon date, and 2018, held two weeks earlier due to Day of German Unity preparations.There have been several title sponsors in the race's history. From 1974 until 1989 it was just the Berlin Marathon. In 1990 it was the Yanase Berlin Marathon. In 1991 and 1992 it was the Canon Berlin Marathon. It reverted to simply the Berlin Marathon from 1993 until 1997. It then became the Alberto Berlin Marathon in 1998 and 1999. A new title sponsor changed the name to real,- Berlin Marathon from 2000-2010. Finally this has been the BMW Berlin Marathon since 2011.\\nThe Berlin marathon and related events are split over two days. Thousands of additional inline skaters compete at the marathon course the Saturday before the running event. Power walkers, hand-bikers, wheelchair riders, and a children's marathon (4.2195 km) are also part of the marathon weekend, which is organised by SCC EVENTS.\\nAlong with five other city races, the World Championships and Olympic Games it forms the Abbott World Marathon Majors, a series offering a $1 million prize purse to be split equally between the top male and female marathoners and lesser amounts for the second and third male/female finishers plus awards for the top wheelchair competitors.\\nThe 2018 edition saw Eliud Kipchoge setting a new world record with a time of 2:01:39. The 33 year old Kenyan improved the former mark set by Dennis Kimetto at the Marathon's 2014 edition by 1:18 minutes. The same race saw also fast times on the women's race with a former course record of 2:19:12 set by Mizuki Noguchi in 2005. Gladys Cherono (Kenya) set a new course reord with 2:18:11, with the runner up Ruti Aga (Ehthopia) with 2:18:34 and third placed Tirusnesh Dibaba finished 2:18:55, both below the old course record.\\n\\n\""
